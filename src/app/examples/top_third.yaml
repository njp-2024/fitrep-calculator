    Sergeant ANON is an immensely talented and effective NCO who operates at a level beyond the grasp of his peers. 
    Hand selected to assume a SNCO billet; he completely outperformed two seasoned Staff Sergeants. An absolute 
    technical expert whose professional skill rivals that of an officer. He directs the various administrative and 
    training requirements of his unit without fault. Demonstrates impeccable moral character and a matchless ability 
    among his peers to lead and inspire Marines and Sailors. The Corps could not find a finer ambassador for 
    recruiting duty. Highly recommended for any officer commissioning program.
