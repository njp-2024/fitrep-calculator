# Human Evaluation Survey Questions

## Survey Introduction

You are evaluating AI-generated section I narrative drafts, created based on
billet, accomplishments, and designated performance tier. All data used to
generate these narratives is synthetic (fake) - no real people or
accomplishments were used.

Review each case and evaluate the narrative. Remember, these are meant to be
initial drafts, or starting points, not final products. When answering,
evaluate the narrative as if you were the Reporting Senior writing the report.
How useful is the narrative to you?

There are 9 cases to evaluate. Each will provide the Rank, name, and billet
and accomplishments (all fake), followed by the narrative and target
performance tier. They all have the same 5 questions. It should take 15-20
minutes to complete.

Thanks for supporting the project!

## Form Layout

Each packet contains 9 narratives. Each narrative is presented in its own
Google Forms section with the evaluation ID as the section title and the
rank, name, billet, accomplishments, target tier, and generated narrative
in the description.

## Questions Per Narrative

### Q1 - Tier Alignment (Required)

Scale: 1-5

| Rating | Label                | Description                                       |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Completely wrong     | Reads like a different tier entirely               |
| 2      | Mostly misaligned    | Some tier-appropriate language but largely off      |
| 3      | Partially aligned    | Mixed signals; could be read as adjacent tier      |
| 4      | Mostly aligned       | Clearly targets the right tier with minor issues   |
