# App Usability Feedback Survey Questions

## Survey Introduction

You just completed 3 synthetic fitrep cases using the Fitrep Calculator app.
This survey asks about your experience with the app and the narratives it
generated. Your feedback will directly inform app development priorities.

All cases used synthetic (fake) data -- no real people or accomplishments were
used. Please answer based on your overall experience across all 3 cases.

There are 16 questions (13 required, 3 optional). It should take 5-10 minutes
to complete.

Thanks for supporting the project!

## Form Layout

Single Google Forms survey with four sections. All participants complete one
survey after finishing all 3 cases.
